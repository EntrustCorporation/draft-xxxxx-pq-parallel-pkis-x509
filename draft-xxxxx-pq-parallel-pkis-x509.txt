   During the transition to post-quantum cryptography, the deployment of
   cryptographic certificates using post-quantum algorithms will face
   two challenges

   o  Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some
      post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully
      trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will
      also start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after
      certificate deployment that a public key algorithm has become
      untrustworthy, but in the interim, they may not know which
      algorithm an adversary has compromised.

   o  Backwards compatibility: During the transition period, post-
      quantum algorithms will not be supported by all clients.

   This document assumes that algorithm strength uncertainty has already
   been solved, for example using the mechanism in draft-xxxxx-pq-
   composite-certs-x509, and provides a mechanism to address backwards
   compatibility: parallel PKI hierarchies in which each entity is
   issued both a classic (traditional single-key) and composite (multi-
   key, multi-signature) certificate such that non composite-aware
   clients will continue functioning, and composite-aware clients can
   detect downgrade attacks.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

Internet-Draft               Composite Certs               December 2018


   This document defines the following terms:

   EDNOTE: Look up the standard way to do glossaries in RFCs.

   EDNOTE: I think there's a proper way to reference another RFC or I-D.
   Look up.

   Traditional Certificate:

   An X.509 certificate conforming to RFC 5280.  In particular, a
   certificate containing a single subject public key, and a single
   issuer signature.

   Composite certificate:

   An X.509 certificate containing two or more subject public keys and
   two or more issuer signatures, for example, as defined in draft-
   xxxxx-pq-composite-certs-x509.

4.  Comparison with draft-truskovsky-lamps-pq-hybrid-x509

   EDNOTE: This section will explain the differences from
   [I-D.truskovsky-lamps-pq-hybrid-x509].  IPR Claims should be
   mentioned here if necessary.  Other things to consider are the things
   we discussed in an email thread like simplicity and format,
   inadvertnt implementation errors, algorithm agility.

   (MO): Move to appendix, or to a supporting document?

5.  Composite Certificates

   This section defines a certificate format containing multiple subject
   public keys and multiple issuer signatures.  This addresses the
   "algorithm strength uncertainty" concern from Section 2, though the
   authors note that this mechanism may have prove to have utility
   beyond the post-quantum migration.

5.1.  Composite Signatures

   EDNOTE: This subsection describes the PKIX Composite Signatures and
   how they work.  It will also explain how signing a certificate will
   work and how verification will work.

   CompositeSignatureAlgorithmIdentifierId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER ...
     -- syntax of the algorithm is CompositeSignatureAlgorithm
   CompositeSignatureAlgorithm ::= SEQUENCE OF AlgorithmIdentifier
   CompositeSignature ::= BIT STRING
     -- Bit string encodes a SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING

5.2.  Composite Public Keys

   EDNOTE: This subsection describes the PKIX Composite Public Keys and
   how they work.

   CompositeSignatureAlgorithm ::= SEQUENCE OF AlgorithmIdentifier
   CompositePublicKeyId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER ...
   CompositePublicKey ::= BIT STRING
     -- Bit string encodes SEQUENCE OF SubjectPublicKeyInfo

6.  Parallel PKI hierarchies

   This section defines a PKI hierarchy structure whereby each entity is
   issued both a classic (traditional single-key) and composite (multi-
   key, multi-signature) certificate such that non composite-aware
   clients will continue functioning, and composite-aware clients can
   detect downgrade attacks.. This addresses the "backwards
   compatibility" concern from Section 2, though the authors note that
   this mechanism may have prove to have utility beyond the post-quantum
   migration.

7.  Certificate Enrollment

   ## PCKS#10 {#sec-p10} EDNOTE: This subsection talks about the new CSR
   attributes.  It will also talk about how requesting these certs will
   work.

   Once an entity in the PKI has a valid composite certificate, it MAY
   send subsequent certificate enrollment requests for traditional
   certificates containing a public key from the composite certificate
   using the same DN.  If the CA has previously issued one or more
   currently valid composite certificates for the same entity,
   containing that public key, and containing the same list of SANs,
   then it MUST include one "wtv_we_call_it" extension pointing to each
   such certificate, and MUST set the certificate expiry date to be not
   later than the expiry date of the referenced composite certificate
   with the {earliest expiry date?, latest expiry date?}.

8.  Certificate Revocation

   EDNOTE: This subsection will talk about compromises of keys,
   revocation and how recovation will be verified.

8.1.  Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)

   EDNOTE: A mention to OCSP implications should be made.

Internet-Draft               Composite Certs               December 2018


   EDNOTE: The mechanism for globally revoking an algorithm should be
   mentioned, along with the practical suggestion that an algorithm MAY
   be globally revoked on the composite PKI's CRL, but not on the
   traditional PKI (unless that suggestion should be entirely moved to
   the parallel-pkis draft?).  Need to think about backwards-
   compatibility of this CRL extension?  Do we need to suggest that CAs
   publish composite and traditional certs on separate CRLs for this
   reason?

8.2.  End-Entity Requested Revocation

   EDNOTE: Be explicit about whether a single-key revocation request has
   the authority to revoke the composite cert, and vice-versa.  EDNOTE:
   We may need to wade into modifications to the CMP / SCEP / EST
   protocols (but I really hope not).

9.  New Algorithm Identifiers

   EDNOTE: This subsection defines the OIDs for the initial composite
   algorithm combinations we want to define.

10.  In Practice

   EDNOTE: This section will talk about practical issue of how these
   certificates will be used.  For example it will talk about the size
   of these certs and cert chains.  It will explain that if a cert in
   the chain is a Composite cert then the whole chain needs to be of
   Composite Certs.  It will also explain that the root CA cert does not
   have to be of the same algorithms.  The root cert SHOULD NOT be
   transferred in the authentication exchange to save transport overhead
   and thus it can be different than the intermediate and leaf certs.
   It will talk about overhead (size and processing).  It will also
   discuss backwards compatibility.  It could include a subsection about
   implementation considerations.

11.  Implications for existing standards

   EDNOTE: This section talks about how protocols like (D)TLS and IKEv2
   are affected by this specifications.  It will not attempt to solve
   all these problems, but it will explain the rationale, how things
   will work and what open problems need to be solved.  It will talk
   about implications of how to distinguish what cert chain to send.  It
   will describe how signature_algorithms extension will be used in TLS.
   What is missing in TLS and IKEv2 like what and how to sign something
   with the two private keys.  It will discuss overhead (size and
   processing) as in Section 10.  It will also discuss PKCS#10.

12.  IANA Considerations

   EDNOTE: This section will include content only if new OIDs or IANA
   codepoints are asigned for it.

   There are no IANA Considerations for this specification.

   (MO): Won't we need to define OIDs for both composite signatures and
   composite public keys?

13.  Security Considerations

   EDNOTE: This section includes the Security Considerations.

14.  Contributors

   EDNOTE: This section includes the contributors of this draft so the
   authors in the first page do not exceed five and thus violate
   RFC2223-bis.  Example where this happens is RFC1122.  We can have
   another Editor for this draft.  Doesn't need to be Panos.

   This document incorporates contributions and comments from a large
   group of experts.  The Editor would especially like to acknowledge
   the tireless dedication of the following people, who attended many
   long meetings and generated millions of bytes of electronic mail over
   the past 3 years months in pursuit of this document: Mike Ounsworth
   (Entrust Datacard), John Gray (Entrust Datacard), Serge Mister
   (Entrust Datacard), Scott Fluhrer (Cisco Systems) and Panos
   Kampanakis (Cisco Systems).

   We are grateful to all, including any contributors who may have been
   inadvertently omitted from this list.
